# Website Student DS Intro

Data Science is statistics: reborn, rethought, and rebranded. For 19th century statisticians, data was a theoretical concept they held in their minds and described in hand-written formulas. In the 21st, it is a new resource, produced daily and gathered at the speed of light. Computing brought new goals and new possibilities, which in turn, brought a new science. This is the science we teach at the Data Science Center at BGSE: it is statistics first and foremost, but equally importantly, it is useful in today's world.
